 <h1> Microwave Cake</h1>

    <img src="../images/micro.jpg">

  <h4> Description </h4>
        <p> Easy fast cake that can be made in the microwave in approximately 12 minutes. My favorite combinations are: chocolate cake mix with cherry pie filling or yellow cake mix with apple pie filling ( I add a bit of cinnamon for flavor to this one.)</p>

 <h5> Ingredients </h5>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix  </li>
        <li> 3 Eggs </li>
        <li> 1 (21 ounce) can apple pie filling </li>
        <li> Â½ cup applesauce </li>
    </ul>

<h5> Directions</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the box of cake mix, eggs, pie filling and applesauce till moist. Use a microwave safe bundt pan or substitute a microwave safe bowl that has a microwave safe cup or cone placed in the middle of it (to mimic a bundt pan). Pour mixture into the bowl around the cup.</li>
        <li>Bake on high for 6 minutes 30 seconds, turn and bake for another 6 minutes 30 seconds on high. Remove from oven and cover bowl with a dish and let stand for 5 minutes (this finishes the cooking process).</li>
        <li> Turn cake over onto dish and remove cone (cup) for a delicious quick dessert. Good hot with vanilla ice cream or whipped topping.</li>
    </ol>
